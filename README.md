# João Alves - Data Analysis Portfolio


### About me ###

Hi, I'm João! I have a business background and have been working in Procurement for Oil companies since the beginning of my career. I started my studies in Data Analysis to facilitate my performance in negotiations and in proposal analysis. 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.
